Before joining **BearyChat** and after in-depth communication, we finally determined an important design principle: Everything we do is based on information. Information can be roughly divided into conversations between team members, messages generated by third-party tools in operation, and documents accumulated. The mission of BearyChat is to organize, rearrange, and add more value to the information. Based on this principle and commercial considerations, I mainly encounter The design of paid version that is suitable for the Chinese market. Strengthen the interaction model of the robot. Create a new, more friendly, and valuable version.

# Design Team

## ‍The Language of UX

<WorkImage position="underH2" />

When I join BearyChat, it had 15 employees which two teams based in Beijing and Shenzhen, and several members working remotely. The team wants to have more efficient communication. The first thing I did was to synchronize everyone's design language for UX. Combining previous experience and learning, I added the team's common flowchart language to the output of the design to reduce the cost of communication. The UML-based flowchart template language: Make the technical team explain the design requirements more intuitively, and develop products based on the common role of status and user experience. Make the design team show the technical logic to the designer more intuitively so that the designer can understand and design the product correctly.

# Design Strategy

## Different with Slack

In addition, I promote the PRD template within the team. It can greatly reduce the reader's mental burden to a certain extent. In general, this is not just an electronic product developed by our designers, the document is a product as well. Frankly speaking, to a large extent, BearyChat is an imitator of Slack in China. The functions required for team communication software are roughly the same, but in terms of design, we put more effort and consideration into the Chinese users’ experience. Taking reminders as an example, the final product of Slack is a command-like tool. Considering that the popularity of QA in China is not high, we will use a pure interface approach. The advantage of it is obvious and the user experience is more intuitive. Moreover, based on the fact that the use of the calendar is not high, I added duplicate settings for the functions. Users can create a reminder and send it to everyone to replace a fixed schedule in the calendar.

## Free To Cost

A year before I joined the team, BearyChat had been designing and developing products based on the premise that it is completely free to use. By understanding the business strategy, I start designing a payment strategy that fits the Chinese market.
Considering that the product is still in the growth period to grow the user base and after comparing other similar products, we significantly increase the number of messages and robots that free users can trace back in the free version.
In the design of team version, in addition to giving the standard full development messages traceback function and increasing the number of robots in the same type of product, based on our interviews with medium and large teams, and considering medium and large teams:
The business is larger, and the requirements are stricter. Their robots produce more messages and the stability requirement is higher. We increased the number of robots available to paying users and provided SAL protocols.
External communication is more frequent, and the privacy requirements of information are higher. The guest feature is the most important difference between us and other similar products, so the number of visitors is vastly different from the average users. And we have improved the functionality of whether visitors can see the historical messages and the cancellation of channel messages.
In addition to the above two versions, almost all large enterprises in the Chinese market have their own independent OA systems, and they completely reject cloud services due to security issues. In terms of product design, we also have an enterprise version that provides private deployment and in-depth customization services.
In business strategy, we consider the enterprise version as the most important source of revenue. To quickly provide customization services in the enterprise version, technically, not only do I write code in a modular manner, but also required modularity in the design. That is, both the logic and the UI are as unrelated as possible between the modules. This allows corporate users to choose multiple modules to form products that are more in line with their business.
In Huawei and Manila Group's enterprise version customization requirements, we delivered products quickly and with high quality. This reflects the value of modular design and the correct use of business strategy.

## New Version

<WorkImage position="underH2" />

After completing the phased feature of the paid version, while mimicking Slack, we also added many features based on the user feedback, operational data, and internal opinions. But due to the lack of a big picture, the overall software experience is not intuitive enough.

Especially for the layout design, our requirements for modular design during the development process lead to the independence of the overall structure. In the past, we just stacked the new functions together according to the logic of whether they are similar or not. To solve this problem, we decided to completely abandon the existing layout and redesign it based on the existing features and short-to-medium-term planning of our products.

## Topography Matter

<WorkImage position="underH2" />

The biggest change is that we completely changed the structure of the software, dividing the structure of the entire software into two:
We modify the navigation menu on the left into a hierarchical structure. Each function is designed as a business-based product module. It makes the user experience more friendly while providing a degree of customizable scalability.
The content area on the right is designed in the navigation menu. The content area always takes the dialog input box as the highest priority. We design it in this way because, in the existing products, all valuable information (whether it's a file, a user's collection, or even the contacts) is generated based on a conversation, or the starting point of a conversation.

## Humanized Robot

Through continuous communication with users, we learned that BearyChat's biggest advantage in the Chinese market is to support huge third-party services. A robot is a very important part of my product design. In the past, chatbots often restructured messages generated by third-party platforms and then sent them to the chat software. If you want to perform subsequent interactions, you need to open a third-party platform page for it. This experience is very unintuitive. To solve this problem, we launched a long-term plan called "Interactive Robots".

<WorkImage position="inline" />

In the short-term plan, we will define some methods to interact with the robot. Through these methods, chatbots can directly use interactive buttons such as input boxes or buttons in BearyChat's interface. It can be designed to give real-time feedback as well.
In the medium to the long-term plan, I will design a robot market. Users can upload their robots and make them available to other users for free or for a fee.
